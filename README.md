A terminal-based game where you battle a dragon. (Made with Python.)

It's a fusion of *Rock Paper Scissors* and a *Pokémon* battle. The player and the dragon have an assigned amount of health. The player chooses an attack style and the dragon will randomly choose an attack style. Based on the combination damage is then calculated.

## Features

* Customised messages for the outcome of each attack.
* Recovery/validation added to allow misinputs without crashing the game.
* Heal functionality. The player has a health potion with limited number of uses.
* Some basic crash handling.

I plan to remake this using objects, but I think I will do that in C#
